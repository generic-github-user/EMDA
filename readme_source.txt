EMDA
	Efficient Multipurpose Data Architecture
	https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png
	EMDA is a human-readable serialization$wiki language for structured data. It draws inspiration from YAML$https://yaml.org/, OGDL$https://ogdl.org/, and similar languages that minimize extraneous syntax and decoration. The main motivations for creating a new format (ie, the goals the format aims to achieve) are:
		Very efficient, painless input and maintenance of SD by humans as a core design feature
			Emphasis on abbreviations, shorthand, and syntactical sugar
		Fluid restructuring and reformatting of text and abstract data woven into the lang's workflow
		Intuitive interfacing with scripting languages like Python$https://www.python.org/
		High flexibility and sensible pathways by which to fit the system to the needs of a particular project
